# Zap Language Server

Full editor support for [Zap](https://zap.redblox.dev), providing syntax highlighting, indentation, and code folding.

Also supports the following features using the [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) (Language Server Protocol):

- üîÆ Information on hover for keywords, primitive types, and user-defined types
- ü™Ñ Completion for keywords, primitive types, and user-defined types
- üéØ Go to definition & renaming for user-defined types
- üìù Full document auto-formatting

## Language Server

The language server can be installed from the [latest release](https://github.com/filiptibell/zap-language-server/releases/latest) using something like [Rokit](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit):

```bash
rokit add filiptibell/zap-language-server
```

Extensions for VSCode and Zed also exist - but installing them is currently a manual process.

When the extensions are feature-complete they will be published to the VSCode and Zed extension stores.

<details>
<summary> Manual Installation - VSCode </summary>

1. [Install Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
2. [Install the VSCode Command Line Interface](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line)
3. Make sure you have installed the language server binary and that it exists on PATH (see instructions above)
4. Clone this repository, and navigate to the `editors/vscode` directory
5. Finally, build and install the extension by running these three commands, in order:
   ```bash
   bun install
   bun pm trust --all
   bun run extension-install
   ```

</details>

<details>
<summary> Manual Installation - Zed </summary>

1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Make sure you have installed the language server binary and that it exists on PATH (see instructions above)
3. Clone this repository, and navigate to the root directory
4. Install the Zed extension at `editors/zed` as a [dev extension](https://zed.dev/docs/extensions/developing-extensions#developing-an-extension-locally)

</details>

## CLI

The language server can also be used as a standalone tool, and includes a CLI for formatting Zap files.

Once installed (see instructions above), the CLI is very similar to [StyLua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua) and/or [prettier](https://prettier.io/).
The formatter is intentionally opinionated and does not have any configuration.

### Formatter

```bash
# Format the specified file, writing results to standard
# output (stdin can be used instead of a file using '-')
zap-language-server fmt <file_path>

# Format the specified file, overwriting it
zap-language-server fmt <file_path> --write

# Check if formatting would change the file contents,
# outputting a diff if it would change - does not write
zap-language-server fmt <file_path> --check
```

### Server

```bash
# Starts the language server using the default transport (stdio)
zap-language-server serve

# Starts the language server using the TCP transport and the given port
zap-language-server serve --port <port_number>
```

## Reporting Bugs

Grammar implementations are pulled from two separate repositories:

- VSCode uses the [TextMate](https://github.com/filiptibell/tmlanguage-zap) grammar.
- Zed uses the [tree-sitter](https://github.com/filiptibell/tree-sitter-zap) grammar.

Please report issues with syntax and/or highlighting to their corresponding linked repositories.
