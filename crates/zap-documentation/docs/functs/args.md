This field determines the data that is sent to the server. It can be any Zap type.

- If the client doesn't send any data, the `args` field should be excluded.
- Parameter names and parentheses are optional to preserve backwards compatibility. If parantheses are excluded, the function can only have one unnamed parameter.
